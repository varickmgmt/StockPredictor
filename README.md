# StockPredictor
A comprehensive analysis tool exploring the influence of external macroeconomic factors on the performance of the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 Index.

Economic_Factors_SPY.ipynb explains the relationship between macroeconomic factors (GDP, Federal Fund Rate, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index) and SPY ETF price (S&P 500 Index). The dataset is between 7/1/2018 and 7/1/2023.

FuturePrediction.ipynb used combined data between 01/01/2023 and 12/15/2023 and applied feature engineering of 20 and 50-day moving averages and 20-day exponential moving averages. The model predicts prices from 10/23/23 and 12/14/2023.

FuturePrediction_L1L2.ipynb used combined data between 01/01/2023 and 12/15/2023 and applied feature engineering of 20 and 50-day moving averages and 20-day exponential moving averages. It also Implements L1 and L2 regularization and Early Stopping. The model predicts prices from 10/23/23 and 12/14/2023.

MIPSP.pptx.pdf contains a comprehensive report on implementing a predictive model for S&P 500 stock prices using macroeconomic indicators. It highlights machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to analyze and forecast market trends.
